Introduction
============

SymEdit is a CMS (Content Management System) built on the Symfony2 framework.
It is designed to be simple to the user, powerful to developer, and secure
from everyone.

Logging In
----------

If your website is located at `http://mysite.com`, then you can login in two
ways:

  1. http://mysite.com/sym-admin
  2. http://mysite.com/login

*Replace mysite.com with the address of YOUR website*

Method 1 will redirect you to your dashboard once you've finished logging in and
method 2 will redirect you to the homepage of your website. You can always
navigate straight to an Administration page - If you aren't logged in, logging
in will redirect you back to that page.

Forgotten Password
------------------

If you are attempting to login and cannot remember your password, navigate to
either `/login` or `/sym-admin`. Once you are on this screen can click the link
that says "Forgot Password." Enter your username or email address to have your
password sent to you via email.

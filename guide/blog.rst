Using the Blog
==============

Creating a New Post
-------------------

We've made creating a new post very easy to do, but still kept some of the more
complicated features available to you. The only required information you need
to create a blog post is the post title, and the content. However, we do suggest
that you supply SEO (Search Engine Optimization) text as well as a summary.


Field Descriptions
------------------

Below you can find the descriptions of all the fields for creating a Post.

Basic Tab
~~~~~~~~~

Title
   The title of your blog post. This title is also used to determine the slug of your blog post (eg. My Title => /my-title)

Author
   Author of the blog post

Status
   Determines the status of your blog post. Posts in "Draft" will not be shown on your site

Categories
   Use this to classify your posts, you may choose multiple categories or none at all

Featured Image
   This field is used to attach an image to your blog post to be displayed in the summary and on the post itself.


SEO Tab
~~~~~~~

The SEO tab is for adding meta tags to your page.

Title
   This will change the text that is rendered in the `title` tag

Description
   Meta Description - What shows up in the description area for most search engines

Keywords
   Meta Keywords

Index
   Whether search engines should index this post

Follow
   Whether search engines should follow links from your post

Summary Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~

The summary tab is used to input the content for your post's summary. The summary
is typically shown when viewing the blog homepage, category views, and can be used
in some widgets. If you don't specify a summary explicitly, one will be chosen for
you based on the beginning of the content you specify. The summary should be used
to provide lead text to get people to read your article.

Content Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~

The content tab is used to input the content for your post. You are encouraged
to use different types of headings and images in your post content to make it
more interesting for the reader.

Deleting a Post
---------------

Deleting a post is fairly simple. Just bring up your list of posts, either click
the post title, or the "Edit" button and then click "Delete Post." You will be
asked to confirm your decision before the post is truly deleted.

*Remember that you can always set your post to "Draft" status so that it won't
appear in your site.*

Creating a Category
-------------------

Posts can be classified into categories so that someone reading your blog can
read articles that are similar if they so choose. Categories themselves don't
hold much information but can be a good way for search engines to find similar
content.

We suggest writing SEO for the page title and description seeing as though
otherwise your page title will be something boring like "General" or "Web Design."

Using Widgets
=============

What Are Widgets?
-----------------

Widgets are small interchangeable "blocks" that you can assign to different parts of your site.
If you wanted to show your latest 3 blog posts, you could do that through a widget. If you
want to have the same picture or message in your sidebar on every page, a widget can do that.

What Is a "Widget Area?"
------------------------

A Widget Area is a section of your website where widgets will appear in the order that you choose.
Typically you will have 4 widget areas:

Featured
    Usually at the beginning of any page. This area is useful for adding callouts or an image gallery to the top of your pages.

Sidebar
    The sidebar shows up to the left or the right side of your page. You will typically need to choose a template with a sidebar in it for this widget area to appear.

Supplemental
    Usually just after the content of your page but above the footer.

Footer
    The very bottom of your website. This is typically used for contact information and newsletters signups.
